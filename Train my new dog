        <h2>Chapter 1: Understanding Puppy Behavior</h2>
        <p>Understanding the stages of puppy development is crucial for effective training and bonding. Puppies go through several stages, each with its unique challenges and milestones.</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Neonatal Period (0-2 Weeks):</strong> Puppies are entirely dependent on their mother for warmth and nutrition. They spend most of their time sleeping and eating.</li>
            <li><strong>Transitional Period (2-4 Weeks):</strong> Puppies begin to open their eyes, hear, and start to walk. They become more aware of their surroundings and littermates.</li>
            <li><strong>Socialization Period (4-14 Weeks):</strong> A critical period where puppies learn to interact with other dogs and humans. Exposure to various people, animals, and environments during this stage is vital for developing a well-adjusted adult dog.</li>
            <li><strong>Juvenile Period (4-6 Months):</strong> Puppies continue to grow and learn about their environment. It's an excellent time to start basic training commands.</li>

        <h2>Chapter 2: Setting Up for Success</h2>
        <p>Preparing your home for a new puppy is essential for their safety and your peace of mind. Here's what you need to get started:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Supplies:</strong> High-quality puppy food, water and food bowls, comfortable bed, crate, chew toys, and grooming tools.</li>
            <li><strong>Home Preparation:</strong> Puppy-proof your home by securing electrical cords, removing toxic plants, and setting up a designated puppy area.</li>
            <li><strong>Routine:</strong> Establish a consistent routine for feeding, potty breaks, playtime, and training to help your puppy feel secure and aid in their development.</li>
        </ul>

    <div class="chapter">
        <h2>Chapter 3: Potty Training</h2>
        <p>Potty training is a pivotal part of puppy care that requires patience and consistency. Follow these steps for a successful potty training experience:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Establish a Routine:</strong> Take your puppy outside frequently, especially after they wake up, during and after playing, and after eating or drinking.</li>
            <li><strong>Pick a Potty Spot:</strong> Choose a specific spot outside for your puppy to do their business. Consistently taking them to the same spot will help them learn where it's appropriate to go.</li>
            <li><strong>Use Positive Reinforcement:</strong> Reward your puppy with treats and praise immediately after they go potty in the correct spot.</li>
            <li><strong>Manage Accidents:</strong> Accidents happen. When they do, clean up thoroughly to remove any scent markers that might attract them back to the same spot.</li>
        </ul>
